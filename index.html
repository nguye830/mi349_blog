            <p>Electronic dance music began to become increasingly popular in Europe starting mainly in the UK and Germany. The most popular genres in the early beginnings of EDM are House, Dance, and Techno music. The increasing popularity of EDM spread across all of Europe before beginning to pick up in the United States. News outlets in the United States started referring to this type of music and all of its genres as a whole as Electronic Dance Music. As EDM started to grow, music festivals started to cater towards the demand and the growing community of EDM lovers. The biggest known EDM festival is called Electronic Daisy Carnival with over 400,000 attendees. This festival is where the biggest EDM artists and DJs get to perform and showcase their music to their fans. EDM festivals are usually grandiose outdoor festivals with multiple stages for multiple artists to perform at once with big and colorful props for stages and light lasers, fireworks, and smoke for visuals. Today, there are hundreds of different subgenres of electronic dance music with the popular genre being House music as EDM is a global billion dollar industry that is continuously growing. As EDM becomes increasingly popular, the community of EDM fans is also growing as well as festival and festival goers.</p>

            <h3>My Favorite Sub-Genres and Popular Artists</h3>

            <p>My personal favorite sub genres of EDM are Melodic Bass, Progressive House, and Dubstep. Melodic Bass is my absolute favorite genre of music. This sub genre can be described as a mix of dubstep and sweet euphoric melodies. Although not every EDM sub genre works well with lyrics and singers accompanying the beats, melodic bass songs often include singing from different artists which I love because I enjoy singing along! Some popular melodic bass artists that I enjoy listening to are Illenium, Slander, and Nurko. Progressive House is another classic sub genre. In my opinion, it is arguably the best sub genre of EDM for new listeners who are just getting into the genre. Progressive House is more melodic with less heavy beats compared to Melodic Bass. It is pretty repetitive and almost always features vocals, similar to Pop music with its most popular artists being well known among many, Avicii, Martin Garrix, and Swedish House Mafia. Finally, Dubstep is pretty intense with heavy bass drops with lots of different rhythms. Unlike Melodic Bass and Progressive house which has a more euphoric and chill atmospheric vibe, Dubstep contains a lot of snares and exaggerated bass wobbles creating more of a dark and intense sound. Some popular Dubstep artists are Skrillex, Excision, and Zeds Dead.</p>
